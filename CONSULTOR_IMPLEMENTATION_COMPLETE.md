# Consultor Module - Intelligent Implementation Complete

## Overview

The Consultor module has been completely refactored to transform it from a scripted chatbot into an intelligent, context-aware business consultant. This document outlines all changes, improvements, and usage guidelines.

---

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Context System

**Before**: Fixed question sequences, robotic interactions
**After**: Dynamic, conversational flow based on collected context

#### New Database Schema
- Added `contexto_coleta` JSONB column to track all collected information
- Added `resumo_etapa` JSONB column for stage summaries
- Added `processos_escopo` JSONB column for process tracking
- Added `visualizado` boolean flag to deliverables for notification system

#### IntelligentContextManager Class
- Evaluates stage completion readiness automatically
- Tracks missing information dynamically
- Calculates confidence scores for stage transitions
- Updates context intelligently from conversations

#### Key Features:
- No more fixed questions - LLM adapts based on what's already known
- Automatic stage advancement when sufficient information is collected
- Context extraction using LLM to parse natural conversations
- Confidence scoring to determine readiness to progress

### 2. Revised Journey Framework (6 Stages)

#### Stage 1: Boas-vindas & Objetivo (Welcome & Objective)
- Introduce consultant and methodology
- Validate user understanding
- Confirm readiness to proceed
- **Deliverable**: None (introductory stage)

#### Stage 2: Anamnese Empresarial (Business Anamnesis)
- Know the user (name, role, experience)
- Know the company (name, sector, size, market time)
- Understand challenges and goals
- **Deliverable**: Professional anamnesis report (HTML)
- **XP Reward**: 100 XP
- **Advancement**: Automatic when all essential info collected

#### Stage 3: Escopo e Priorização (Scope & Prioritization)
- Map company areas (minimum 3)
- Understand each area's responsibilities and challenges
- Define priority order for execution
- **Deliverable**: General process map (HTML)
- **XP Reward**: 250 XP + 150 XP on prioritization
- **Advancement**: Automatic when areas mapped and prioritized

#### Stage 4: Modelagem AS-IS (AS-IS Modeling)
- Each **process from scope** becomes an independent substage
- Collect 7 attributes per process:
  1. INPUT - Process inputs
  2. OUTPUT - Process outputs
  3. FERRAMENTAS - Tools and systems
  4. MÉTRICAS - KPIs and metrics
  5. REGRAS - Business rules
  6. FLUXO - Step-by-step workflow
  7. PESSOAS - People involved
- **Deliverables**: BPMN diagram + AS-IS summary per process
- **XP Reward**: 300 XP per area completed
- **Advancement**: Process-by-process within each area

#### Stage 5: Diagnóstico (Diagnosis)
- Automatic consolidation of all AS-IS mapping
- Present comprehensive diagnosis
- Request user confirmation
- **Deliverable**: Complete diagnosis report (HTML)
- **XP Reward**: 150 XP
- **Advancement**: User confirmation required

#### Stage 6: Plano de Ação (Action Plan)
- Generate 5W2H action plan per process
- Explain implementation approach
- Request approval before moving to Kanban
- **Deliverable**: 5W2H action plan + Kanban board
- **XP Reward**: 300 XP
- **Advancement**: Manual approval to execution

### 3. No More JSON in Chat

**Before**: Technical markers and JSON objects exposed to users
**After**: Clean, friendly messages only

#### Implementation:
- `cleanTechnicalMarkers()` function removes all technical markers
- `[AVANÇAR_ETAPA:stage]` markers processed internally, never shown
- Advancement triggers happen silently in backend
- User sees only conversational, professional responses

### 4. Intelligent Prompt System

#### IntelligentPromptBuilder Class
- Builds dynamic system prompts based on current context
- Adapts instructions per stage with collected information
- Shows LLM what's missing vs what's already known
- Prevents repetitive questions

#### Context-Aware Prompting:
```javascript
// LLM sees collected context
"Contexto Já Coletado:
- nome_usuario: João Silva
- empresa_nome: TechCorp
- segmento: Tecnologia"

// LLM sees what's missing
"Informações Faltantes:
- Porte da empresa
- Desafios principais"
```

### 5. Analytical Deliverable Generation

**Before**: Copy-paste chat messages into templates
**After**: LLM synthesizes and analyzes information

#### Features:
- Context extraction from conversations using separate LLM call
- Structured information parsing
- Professional, executive-level writing
- Beautiful HTML templates with modern styling
- Proper business document formatting

#### Templates Include:
- Anamnesis report with company profile

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_notify_new_entregavel
AFTER INSERT ON entregaveis_consultor
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_new_entregavel();
```

#### Frontend Integration:
- Real-time Supabase channels
- Badge counters update instantly
- Visual pulse animations for attention
- Automatic counter reset when tab opened

### 7. Gamification Enhancements

**Already Working**: Level-up and achievement modals display automatically

#### XP Rewards Per Stage:
- Anamnese Complete: 100 XP
- Mapeamento Complete: 250 XP
- Priorização Defined: 150 XP
- AS-IS Area Mapped: 300 XP

- Action Completed: 50 XP
- Area Fully Completed: 500 XP bonus

#### Level System:
- 1000 XP per level
- Progress bar with smooth animations
- Level-up modal with celebration

### 8. Automatic Panel Loading

**Before**: Required page refresh to see journey
**After**: Loads immediately on component mount

#### Implementation:
- `useEffect` loads journey on mount
- Real-time subscriptions set up immediately
- No race conditions between data and UI
- Loading states display instantly

### 9. Process-Based Substage Architecture

**Before**: Substages were process attributes (input, output, etc.)
**After**: Substages are the actual business processes in scope

#### Example:
```
Área: Financeiro
├─ Processo 1: Fechamento Mensal ✓
│  ├─ Input, Output, Ferramentas, etc.
├─ Processo 2: Contas a Pagar ⏳
│  ├─ Input, Output, Ferramentas, etc.
└─ Processo 3: Conciliação Bancária ⏸️
```

Each process becomes an independent conversation thread where all 7 attributes are collected naturally.

## Migration Path

### For Existing Journeys:
1. Run migration: `20251012000000_add_consultor_intelligence_system.sql`
2. Existing journeys will have empty `contexto_coleta` (works fine)
3. LLM will start collecting context from next message
4. No data loss or breaking changes

### For Existing Deliverables:
1. All existing deliverables get `visualizado = false` by default
2. Will show as "NOVO" until first viewed
3. No need to backfill data

---

## Support

### Common Questions:

**Q: Can I go back to a previous stage?**
A: No, the journey is linear. However, you can always view previous deliverables.

**Q: What if I want to change information from anamnesis?**
A: Start a new journey or manually edit deliverable HTML files.

**Q: Can I work on multiple areas in parallel?**
A: Yes! The system supports parallelism based on prioritization rules.

**Q: How do I know when a stage is complete?**
A: The LLM will explicitly say "We have everything we need" and advance automatically.

**Q: What happens if I close the browser mid-journey?**
A: All progress is saved. When you return, the journey continues from where you left off.
